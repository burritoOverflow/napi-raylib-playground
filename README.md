First, for building RayLib:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raysan5/raylib.git
cd raylib

cmake -S . -B buildRelease -G Ninja \
         -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
         -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON \
         -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF \
         -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/raylib

cmake --build buildRelease --target install --verbose
```

(The above is packaged into `installRaylib.sh` for ease of installation)

`NOTE`: Everything here otherwise assumes this install path and the linking raylib statically. Change the install path here and in `bindings.gyp` at your own discretion. Also, only a Linux build is currently configured and supported. (see: `bindings.gyp`)

Once RayLib is installed:

```bash
npm install --verbose
npm run build
```

If [Bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear?tab=readme-ov-file) is installed, `compile_commands.json` can be generated by running: `npm run build:commands`

`Note:` `gyp` requires installation of `setuptools` (a global install might not be the best approach)

```bash
pip install setuptools
```

Run `demo.js` for a basic use of the exported APIs.
